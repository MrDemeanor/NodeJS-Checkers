# Centipede-Army Checkers
This will be a comprehensive guide on how to launch the server that houses the Centipede Army Checkers game. Additionally, we will discuss how to run the test script to make sure that the server is running properly, and how to tunnel the server to NGROK so as to bypass preexisting network restrictions when trying to run multiplayer. This guide will explain how to run the server for both Mac/Linux and Windows. This guide  will assume that you have the Git CLI installed, as well as NodeJS, NPM, Pip, and Python 3.
